1. **Use Comments / Docstrings**: Document functions and classes with docstrings to explain their purpose. Write comments for maintainability but do not overdo it.
1. **Use Virtual Environments**: Isolate project dependencies using virtual environments (e.g., `venv`).
1. **Use Type Hints**: Utilize type hints for better code clarity and type checking.
1. **Avoid Global Variables**: Limit the use of global variables to reduce side effects.
